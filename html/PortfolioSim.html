         <p>This project is an attempt to see how different portfolio compositions
            would perform in different scenarios.  This approach involved developing
            a Markov Model simulation for major asset classes that was developed through
            a neural network trained on data starting in 1929.  Another major factor in
            this approach is that it gives a number of different outcomes for the same
            portfolio.  This is important as over long time horizons, small changes in
            returns compound to a large difference (over 40 years, a 6% return will result
            in a $1 becoming $10.29, while a 6.5% return will result in $12.42). This is in
            contrast to many retirement calculators which attempt to find exactly how much
            will be needed, which is impossible to do.

         <p>To develop a Markov Model simulation, historical data on asset returns, as
            well as other financial data were used.
            These additional values do not attribute directly to asset
            returns, but they could potentially hold some important information that could
            influence how markets behave; a crash that occured with a dramatic decrease in
            GDP may behave differently over long periods of time than a crash that occured
            during a period where the economy did not have these issues.
         </p>
         <p>For the network predictions, the goal was to predict a distribution rather than
            a singular result.  Predicting a single result would lead to the network predicting
            average returns and would not predict crashes or booms.  Instead, the model will be
            predicting a distribution of returns for each time step, then when a simulation is
            run it will select a value from that distribution.  This distribution will be generated
            by predicting for each variable how many std deviations they will be from the mean.  
            Methods that use neural networks
            to predict distributions were not used because they introduce bias in assuming what
            the distribution will be; they are not the same for all variables, and in the past
            they have typically not been normally distributed: S&P and REIT returns have a large
            left-tail where market crashes often have large losses, while Gold returns have a 
            left-tail that only has been 2 std deviations below the mean, but a right-tail being
            5 std deviations above it.
         </p>
         <p>For this approach, an issue that comes up is that if the network were to predict a
            distribution for all variables, the number of buckets will grow exponentially.  To solve
            this problem, rather than have a single neural network predict all of the variables,
            a neural network was developed for each individual variable. The variables were
            ordered in a way where those which were thought to be more causal were given lower
            indices, and those that are more of an effect of the environment are placed lower.
            For example, GDP growth is given a lower index than S&P 500 returns, with the
            justification being that GDP growth would influence S&P returns rather than S&P
            returns influencing GDP.  This is a potential source of bias in these results
            as there is not a formulaic way to determine this.
         </p>
         <p>For the nth variable, the network is attempting to predict the return given all
            of the variables in the previous timestep, and the 0 through n-1th variable in this
            time step.  To reduce the amount of input variables used to train the models,
            only certain variables which were eligible were considered.  These variables were
            determined using correlations between variables, as well as my domain knowledge
            of how certain variables are believed to interact.  For example, the returns on 
            10-Year Treasuries only used the previous 10yr rate as well as the change in the
            10-Year rate for this time step.  While this does introduce bias into the model,
            it significantly reduced the variance and led to much better results than without.
         </p>
         <p>Another important consideration is that for REITs, there is only data on them going
            back to 1972.  The REIT investment vehicle was only created in 1960, and it took
            a significant amount of time for enough to reach the public markets to get a 
            diversified set of properties that represents how they are today.  One approach would
            be to simply limit the data through 1972, but that would cut the amount of datapoints
            in half, and the data pre-1972 likely has some differences from the post-1972 data.
            Instead, an additional neural network was trained on the post-1972 data to guess
            what the pre-1972 REIT data was, and then that was used to train the simulation networks.

      <button class="dropbtn">Takeaways</button>
      <div class="dropdown-content" id="takeaways">
         <p>One of the major takeaways from this experiment was looking at the wide range
            of possibilities that could occur from a single portfolio.  For a portfolio that
            was 100% stocks, the 5th percentile return was 3.6x, while the 95th percentile return
            was 36.3x.  For retirement-focused investing, where the goal is not to maximize returns
            but to ensure that one has enough, it could be benefitial to use methods that
            increase returns in the low-return scenarios by selling upside in the high-return ones.
         </p>
         <p>Another major takeaway is the importance of diversification.  Over 40 years, a 100% stock
            portfolio has a 5th percentile return of 3.6x.  A 100% REIT portfolio has a 5th percentile
            return of 2.9x.  A 50-50 Stock/REIT portolfio has a 5th percentile return of 7.7x.
         </p>
         <p>A third takeaway is the poor performance of portfolios that hold bonds over long periods of
            time.  While it is not surprising that these portfolios have a lower expected return, a 
            50/50 Stock/REIT portfolio has a better 5th percentile performance over 40 years than a
            40/40/20 Stock/REIT/10yr over the same period (7.7x vs 6.2x).  Many portfolios that use
            historical results for 80/20 portfolios start from the 1970s, when the 10 year interest rate
            was typically above 6% and went briefly over 14%.  This is contrasted with roughly 4% as of
            early 2024, leaving them with far less upside if inflation is low.
         </p>
         <p>On gold, I have typically found with my model that it does not increase portfolio
            performance compared to solely S&P/REITs.  This is in constrast to many other approaches
            based on historical performance(see <a href="https://www.artemiscm.com/research-papers/category/Research+Paper">The Allegory of the Hawk and Serpent</a> as these analyses typically have lead to a higher-recommended
            gold allocation than advisors typically say, often around 20%.  One of the concerns I have about
            this with my model is that gold has a significant amount of its returns in short periods of
            time (returns of 127% in 1979, 73% in 1973 and 66% in 1974), so if my model is not able to
            correctly capture the extreme results, it could be significantly affecting the results.
         </p>
         <p>Another area of concern is the limited memory of the model.  There are not a large number of
            data points, so only a first order model was used.  This helped to prevent overfitting, but
            this does result in a loss of information from previous terms.  This could lead to this model
            having variables reverting to their mean much faster than it may in reality.  This is a major
            issue in long-term financial models, as there is not enough data for many of the modern neural-network
            architectures to be useful.
