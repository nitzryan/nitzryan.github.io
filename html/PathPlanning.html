            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>This project involved guiding multiple agents throughout a map, with
                the agents having to avoid each other while trying to reach their destination
                in an efficient manner.  This is accomplished in two steps.  The first step is to
                create a map of nodes that an agent is capable of visiting with edges connecting nodes
                that can be traveled between with no obstacles.  The second step is to create the logic
                that will allow for the agents to move throughout the map, following a given target while
                avoiding other agents.  The agents do not have access to the pathing of other agents; they
                only have access to their current position and velocity.
            </p>
         </div>

         <div class="section">
            <h2>Path Planning</h2>
            <p>For the map generation, a number of nodes are placed in the configuration space for the agents: one
                node just on the inside of every room, another just on the outside of every room, and a number of nodes
                generated through a probabilistic roadmap.  Connections are then drawn between
                the nodes, given the following constraints.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The nodes must be within a certain distance (approximately 1/3 of the map)</li>
                <li>An agent must be able to walk in a straight line between the nodes without colliding with the environment</li>
                <li>If the node is within a room, it can only be connected to the node immediately outside of the room.  This significantly
                    increased the performance of nodes exiting the room, as they would exit and then try to get to their destination
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>The resulting nodes & paths are shown below</p>
            <img src="/img/path_nodes.png" width="25%">
            <img src="/img/path_paths.png" width="25%">
            <p>For every agent that is spawned, it will have a destination at one of the room nodes.  With this condition, using
                the D* path planning algorithm was used.  For creating the maps, the computational complexity is O(rooms * nodes), and then
                unless the map itself is changed an agent can get the best path from the D* map for the given destination.
            </p>
            <p>When agents are moving through the map, they will have a force that is guiding them to their next target.  This target will be a current
                node in the path obtained from D*.  The agent does not need to go to the precise location of each node; if there
                is a clear direct path from the current location to the node after the current target node, the current target node is replaced
                with the next target node.  Additionaly, as there will be other forces that will push an agent off
                of its ideal path, if an agent does not have a clear direct path to its current target node, the current target will
                be set to the previous node in the best path.

            <h2>Collision Avoidance</h2>
            <p>The agent will be guided through the simulation by a number of different forces that influence
                its movement.  In the event of a collision, the velocity of both agents will be set immediately to (0,0).
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Path Force.  A force that guides the agent to the current node in its best path</li>
                <li>TTC Force.  A force that seperates agents based on the Time-To-Collision based on their current velocities</li>
                <li>Wall Force.  A force that forces an agent away from a wall</li>
                <li>Imminent Collision Force.  A force that guides an agent from moving into another agent.  This force takes effect
                    at much shorter distances than the TTC force, and it only effects the agent that is moving into a collision.  This force
                    has no effect on an agent that is not moving, but has another agent that is moving into it.
                </li>
                <li>Avoid Wrong Direction Force.  A force that slows the velocity (but keeps the direction) when the current
                    direction is far enough off from the target direction.  Currently, this effect starts at 90deg off and maximizes at 180deg off.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>The TTC force is the most complicated of these forces, and it is also the most impactful in avoiding collisions with
                other agents.  This force is calculated as follows.
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Determine where the two agents will be when they collide.  If they will not collide, or if the Time-To-Collision is
                    longer than some configuration time, the force is ignored.
                </li>
                <li>Determine the direction that each agent would need to move so that there would not be a collision.  This should
                    be opposite directions for each agent, and they should be along the axis perpendicular to the tangent of the
                    collision point.
                </li>
                <li>Apply a force to each agent in this direction, scaled inversely by the time to collision.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>This results in agents taking small deviations over a long period to avoid collsions that are forseable far away, 
                and taking more drastic measures for imminent collisions.
            </p>
            <p>The imminent collision force was added because TTC forces were not able to handle agents that were close to obstacles.
                The main scenario this addressed was when an agent was between another agent and a wall; that agent would be pushed towards the
                wall by the other agent, and the wall would guide it away from it, resulting in a large number of collisions.
            </p>

            <h2>Results</h2>
            <img src="/img/path_overview.gif" width="33%">
            <p>The agents are all able to get to their destination with a low number of collisions.
                The current configuration of parameters was set in a way that would allow for some small
                collisions, but had agents moving considerably faster than what would be done for agents that
                could not collide. This is simulating the results of how humans move in crowded spaces; while
                people attempt to avoid collisions, they do sometimes occur without much impact, especially those at
                low speeds.
            </p>
            <p>For agents that are approaching each other moving in opposite directions, the planning does a
                good job at avoiding collisions while minimizing the amount of lost time compared to the pathing
                without collisions.  This result was able to be obtained solely from the TTC forces.  The addition of the
                immediate avoidance force tends to cause agents to give more space when passing by agents than
                necessary, which is less efficient but may be more realistic than those with TTC alone.  This was an added
                benefit and was not the expected behavior when this was implemented.
            </p>
            <p>The added force to stop agents from being forced in the wrong direction by other agents
                does result in a smoother simulation, but the results were not perfect and the aggresiveness of
                this force resulted in a significant tradeoff.  If this force was too low, the agents would often go
                significantly off their path, while if it was made higher they would do a better job sticking to the path
                but would occasionally stop aggressively.  The image below shows this; the middle agent was getting
                pressured by the agent behind it, but after getting too far off the path it would stop, causing the agent behind to
                collide with it as it stopped faster than it expected.  Even with these collisions being added in, I 
                felt that the more aggressive stopping led to better overall results.
            </p>
            <img src="/img/path_stopping.gif" width="15%">
            <p>There were a couple of other areas this scenario could be improved.  The agents sometimes will collide with
                the walls near the openings of rooms that they are trying to enter or exit.  Agents also struggle when
                two are going in roughly the same direction, but they need to cross over each other.  For example, if two agents 
                are both going up, but the one on the left wants to go to the upper-right and the one on the right wants to go to 
                the upper-left, they will both walk upwards with the TTC forces keeping them apart in the left/right direction.  After moving
                further up, they will need to move more horizontally than vertically and will be too close for the TTC forces to work well.
                This could likely be improved by having each agent have slightly different values for different forces, as these
                differences would likely cause them to not move together as much when moving upwards.
            </p>
            <p>Another area for improvement would be using a better method to generate the node locations.  Currently it is randomly 
                sampling locations in the valid configuration space.  This approach gives more points in areas with lots of space, as
                well as causing random clumps of a large number of nodes and random areas of few.  One method to improve this would be
                to use a random generation method that prevents generating points too close to other points.  Another method would be 
                to take points that are not in the configuration space and project them into the space; this would cause areas that don't have
                much area in the configuration space be more likely to be assigned nodes, which would result in better planning.
