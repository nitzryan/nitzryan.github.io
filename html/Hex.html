            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>This project involves creating an AI agent that is capable of playing the
                board game Hex.  The agent is capable of playing against itself, or against
                a human player.  The application is a Qt C++ desktop application.
            </p>
            <p>The application, along with playing the game, is capable of moving back to a previous board
                state and doing an evaluation at that state, potentially for even longer than what was originally done.
                For each position, it can show the following metrics for each board state.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Score (following best path for each agent)</li>
                <li>Heuristic Score (not looking further down the path)</li>
                <li>Number of Children (number of boards evaluated after this move was made)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This is able to be traversed down in a tree-like structure as shown below.  This was an 
                extremely useful tool in debugging; often what were thought to be bugs in the program were
                rather just an unoptimal heuristic function, or the agent seeing something that I did not see
                myself.

            <h2>Hex Overview</h2>
            <p>The game of Hex is a 2 player game.  Each player takes turns placing
                a single tile on any unoccupied place.  The purpose of the game is to 
                place a chain of tiles that connects both of your ends to each other.
                Each game of hex will end in a win for one player; a tie is not possible
                (even stronger, if every tile is randomly selected as red or blue, one of
                the colors will have a connection between sides).
            </p>
            <img src="/img/hex_game.gif" width="480px">
            <p>While the rules of the game are simpler than many other games, the game itself
                has a large amount of depth to it.  On larger boards (the largest with major
                play is a 19x19 board), it took until 2019 for a computer program to beat the
                top player, and the game has only been solved on boards 9x9 and below.

            <h2>Algorithm Overview</h2>
            <p>To create an agent that is capable of playing the game, the
                Monte Carlo Tree Search algorith was used.  This algorithm involves four steps
                that are done recursively until some condition is met, in this case being that
                the alloted time is used up.
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>From the root node, choose the best move for the agent that corresponds
                    with the move.  Repeat until an agent is found that does not have scores for
                    its children.
                </li>
                <li>Evaluate each possible move using a heuristic function</li>
                <li>Set the score of this node to the best score for that agent</li>
                <li>Propogate back up the game board, updating the scores if the 
                    new tile score changes what an agent's best move would be
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>One issue that these types of algorithms can have is balancing between making sure
                that all of the evaluations are not done on just the best path(s), and not performing
                computation on paths that have little to no chance of yielding a good move (depth vs breadth).  The choice
                that was used in this implementation was that, for each set of steps, the best path is
                evaluated but a penalty is applied based on how deep it is in the tree.  This results in
                poor paths being discarded immediately, while preventing the system from focusing too
                much on a single path.  A major downside of this approach is that it requires tuning the
                weight for the penalty, which may result in it performing differently in different board states.

            <h2>Heuristic Overview</h2>
            <p>To calculate a heuristic score to approximate a position, the following
                items are used.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>A center score, where tiles closer to the center are worth more points.
                    Red tiles add to the score, blue subtract
                </li>
                <li>A tempo offset, where the score is offset depending on which player has the
                    next move.  This is necessary as otherwise every red move improves red's position
                    and every blue move improves blue's position, which results in the score often depending
                    more on who had the last move in the path in the tree rather than the actual position score.
                </li>
                <li>The rank length of the longest red and blue chains.  A chain is a set of
                    tiles that are all connected of the same color.  The rank length only considers
                    the difference in either row (for red) or column (for blue) along the chain.
                </li>
                <li>The rank length of the longest red and blue template chains.  In a template chain,
                    the tiles are not all physically connected, but rather the opposing player has no
                    possible way of preventing a connection given proper play.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>The first template is a standard one.  If a player has two chains that have two or
                more open tiles that are adjacent to both chains, it is not possible for the opponent to
                prevent the chains from becoming connected.  In the example shown below, the two red 
                tiles are not connected.  If blue moves on 18, red can move to 25, and vica versa.  So while
                the tiles are not physically connected, blue has no possibility of preventing a connection
                assuming red plays properly.
            </p>
            <img src="/img/hex_template.png" width="240px">
            <p>The next template is an edge template.  In this template, if a chain has two or more
                open adjacent tiles that are connected to one of the player's edges, the opponent can't stop 
                a connection from being made to that edge.  In the example shown below, blue cannot prevent
                red from connecting to the top edge, as playing on 3 would be countered with connecting on 4, and 
                vica versa.
            </p>
            <img src="/img/hex_edge.png" width="180px">
            <p>For edges, there are a number of templates that can be formed with the edge from further
                away if most of the tiles are not occupied.  A number of these special edge templates can be
                found <a href="http://www.mseymour.ca/hex_book/hexstrat9.html">here</a>, with some of the more common
                ones implemented in this agent, with the ability to add additional ones just by adding an entry
                to a dictionary.  These are useful in the beginning of the game, as it prevents an agent from trying
                to block a connection that it has no possiblity of doing.
            </p>
            <p>A major issue that came up with this approach of build a large chain or template chain is that
                an agent would often have a long chain that it had no ability to expand in a certain direction.  In
                the example below, red has a chain of length 4, but it has no immediate moves that allow for it to 
                expand upwards as the red tile on 18 is blocked by the tiles on 11 and 12.  This results in the agent
                not seeing any moves that improve its position, so it will often make poor moves until it sees moves that blocks
                the opponent from making good moves.
            </p>
            <img src="/img/hex_poison.png" width="240px">
            <p>The solution to this was to introduce a poison mechanic.  A tile is considered poisoned in
                a direction for a player if there is not an open adjacent tile in the next rank in the direction.
                In this scenario, tiles 17 and 18 are poisoned in the upwards direction for red, as the next
                move needs to be on the same rank rather than on the next rank, so the chain of rank length 4
                is really of rank length 3.  Tiles that are poisoned in a direction are also considered to determine
                if tiles should be poisoned, so tile 24 would also be poisoned in the upwards direction for red, 
                as 17 and 18 are both poisoned in that direction, resulting in a chain length of only 2 for this chain.
                Any tiles that are part of a template or edge connection are also considered occupied.
            </p>
            <p>There approach has some disadvantages to it.  In some scenarios it does over-penalize a position; 
                a chain of rank 4 that is poisoned to rank 2 could have a single move that would make it a rank 4 chain
                again.  Overall, this method led to significantly better agent performance, as agents were able
                to avoid positions where they had a long chain that they were not able to advance.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Current Performance</h2>
            <p>Currently, the agent is able to play well on smaller boards, with its performance on a 7x7
                board being better than my own, and performing roughly to my ability on a 9x9 board.  On larger boards,
                the performance of the agent gets significantly worse and can easily be beaten by a decent human player.
                The major issue is that in the early game for larger boards, simply building a long chain is not
                a winning strategy.  The agent has no concept of territory (which is a major idea for Hex strategy), so it
                builds a long chain that a human is able to completely block on a single side, leaving the agent
                in too deep of a hole for its superior endgame play to dig out of.
            </p>
            <p>Another issue that arises in larger boards is that the agent currently has no knowledge about
                openings.  While a human player would behave like a dictionary for the first few moves, just making
                a move that theorists have spent long amounts of time analyzing, the agent is calculating the position in a
                few seconds.  This often leads to poor early moves, which also leave the agent in a hole it is not
                capable of escaping from.
            </p>
            <p>Another issue that affects the performance on all board sizes is that the agent often spends a large amount
                of its time calculating moves that have no real possiblity of improving the position, but just delay the game.
                An example is shown below; in a board evaluation, the agent evaluated over 300,000 boards for blue making
                a move that does not accomplish anything as red currently has an edge template on the bottom edge.  The reason
                that the agent does this is that when the board state gets further expanded, the positions are worse for the agent
                than it initially believed.  This results in the agent simply performing moves that prevent it from looking further
                down the board state and realizing it is doing poorly.
