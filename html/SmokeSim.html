            <h2>Smoke Simulation Method</h2>
            <p>For the simulation on just following a gas through space, the space was split
                into a 2D grid with cells of fixed size.  At each time step, the velocity (in 2D)
                and amount of gas is stored for each cell.  For each time step, the change in velocity
                and amount of gas were calculated using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navier%E2%80%93Stokes_equations">Navier-Stokes equations</a>
                , with the amount of gas being represented as the density in the equations.  This results in three different
                things modifying the state each step: changes due to advection, changes due to diffusion,
                and either external sources (for density) or external forces (for velocity).  The approach for
                many of the numerical calculations was taken from <a href="https://www.dgp.toronto.edu/public_user/stam/reality/Research/pdf/GDC03.pdf">Real-Time Fluid Dynamics for Games</a>.
            </p>
            <p>All simulations done were 2D simulations; however this approach can be expanded to 3D with no major
                issues, other than increasing computational demand.  All simulations were also done on a CPU single-threaded, which
                could be significantly sped up by using multiple threads or using a GPU if available.

            <h2>Smoke Simulation Results</h2>
            <p>Below are some results for this simulation, for the same scenario with different values for the
                time step and number of cells.  This shows that this simulation is highly sensitive to the timestep,
                with a large amount of information being lost with large timesteps.  The first and second simulations are
                able to be run in real-time on a single-threaded CPU, while the 3rd was not able to be rendered in real time.

            <p>Looking at the low detail simulation, the flow is far to basic, missing the curls
                that occur in the more detailed simulations and in reality.  The medium and high detail
                simulations both produce generally the same shape, but with the medium simulation missing
                some of the more minor details.  
            </p>
            <p>For renderings that do not need to occur in real time and are highly concerned with accuracy,
                the parameters should be increased to as high as feasible in GPU-run code.  Since this was done
                in CPU code, I have not explored much into increases in cells vs timestep for simulations more
                intensive than what was shown here.  Many applications, however, do require running in real time.
                For these, the medium detail scenario gives a reasonable result while leaving system resources
                available for other tasks.  The medium detail scenario could also be upscaled in a way that
                could increase the render quality while not affecting the simulation data itself.

            <h2>Fire Simulation Method</h2>
            <p>The fire simulation is an extension of the smoke simulation, with the temperature of each cell
                being tracked as well as the density and velocity.  This temperature both diffuses (conduction) and
                advects like the previous terms, and it also changes the pressure using the ideal gas law.  This approach
                makes no differention between smoke and fire, but simulates this in the rendering by having the color
                change by the temperature of the gas to simulate the light being radiated from the higher temperatures.
            </p>
            <p>Using this method, the results looked like a composite fire rather than an actual one; the system
                would reach a steady-state result which did not match the chaotic state of a fire.  Two sources of randomness
                were introduced.  The first was to vary the source function over both time and location to simulate the fire
                growing and shrinking over time, as well as occasionaly having flares at certain points.  The second method
                was taken from <a href="https://matthias-research.github.io/pages/tenMinutePhysics/21-fire.pdf">Ten Minute Physics</a>
                which involved adding random swirls above the fire source.  These two changes resulted in a much more
                dynamic fire.

            <img src="/img/fire.gif">
            <p>The results for this simulation gives a good general fire.  There are some methods that could improve the rendering
                that do not involved changing the simulation itself.  The source function could be modified to give more random values
                (currently it is just multiple offset sine waves).  The conversion between smoke value and temperature to color is arbitrary
                in the current rendering and may be degrading the quality of the simulation data itself.  For the GPU rendering
                (which is done in OpenGL), the RGB value is calculated per cell and OpenGL is interpolating between cell values, but
                modifying the GPU kernel to take in the simulation data per cell and do the interpolation on the sim data would lead to better
                results, as the relationship between temperature and color is not linear at all values.
